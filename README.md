This is the final project I completed for the Google-sponsored Computer Science Computing Initiative. I collaborated with one other team member:

We used the p5 Javascript library to build an arcade-style game inspired by Space Invaders, in which the difficulty increases as the player gains more points by shooting incoming enemy ships.

If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
